Requirements
============
 -- CMake 2.8.9 or later (3.0 or later recommended)
 -- Qt 5.0 or later
 -- OpenBabel 3.1 or later (downloaded automatically from
  https://github.com/thosoo/openbabel if not found)
 -- Eigen 3.x


Basic Installation
==================
These instructions give a very basic overview of how to configure, compile and
install Avogadro on most systems.  If you are using unique install locations
and/or libraries are not automatically detected please consult the 'Advanced'
section.

1. Create a 'build' directory in the package source directory.

   mkdir build
   cd build

2. Configure the build system

   cmake ../

3. Compile

   make -j2

4. Install

   sudo make install


Advanced
========
The build system (CMake) provides mechanisms for specifying non-standard
installation locations.

   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX : specify the installation prefix
                            (default /usr/local)

   -DLIB_INSTALL_DIR : specify the install location for libraries
                       (default ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib)

   OpenBabel will be downloaded and built automatically unless these variables
   or `OpenBabel3_DIR` are set to use an existing installation.

   -DOPENBABEL2_LIBRARIES : specify the OpenBabel2 libraries (optional)

   -DOPENBABEL2_INCLUDE_DIR : specify the OpenBabel2 include directory (optional)

   -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR : specify the Eigen include directory (also forwarded
                          to the bundled Open Babel build)

   The following variables are also passed to the bundled Open Babel build when
   defined. They allow overriding dependency locations:
     INCHI_INCLUDE_DIR / INCHI_LIBRARY
     CAIRO_INCLUDE_DIRS / CAIRO_LIBRARIES
     RAPIDJSON_INCLUDE_DIRS
     MAEPARSER_DIR (with maeparser_INCLUDE_DIRS/maeparser_LIBRARIES)
     coordgen_DIR (with coordgen_INCLUDE_DIRS/coordgen_LIBRARIES)
    LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR / LIBXML2_LIBRARIES
    ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR / ZLIB_LIBRARY
    wxWidgets_LIB_DIR
    LIB_INSTALL_DIR

   -DENABLE_PYTHON : specify whether to build Boost.Python interpreter
                    (default = TRUE)

   -DENABLE_UPDATE_CHECKER : Enable checking for new Avogadro versions over the
                             network - Linux distributions may want to disable.

For more information please consult the CMake documentation.

Avogadro uses a few environment variables to find things at runtime. If Avogadro
is installed to the location specified at compile time none of these variables
need to be set.

AVOGADRO_TRANSLATIONS - the location of the translation files.
BABEL_LIBDIR - the location of Open Babel format plugins
BABEL_DATADIR - the location of Open Babel data files
